# Reddit Image Bot

## Description:
This is a reddit bot I made using the praw package that takes in a few arguments that specify whether you want links returned or images to be downloaded and you can specify how many images to return/download and the subreddits you want to return/download them from.

## Usage:
* python bot.py -r [number of images to return > 0] [subreddits]
* python bot.py -d [number of images to download > 0] [subreddits]
